Welcome to pyRAP!
=================

`pyrap` is a framework for implementing extremely powerful and 
beautiful web-based AJAX applications in pure Python. No HTML. No 
JavaScript. No PHP. Just pure Python. It has been designed as a 
lightweight, easy-to-use yet powerful library that makes development of
`SaaS applications <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service>`_
as easy and fast as possible.

Showroom
--------

The showroom contains a couple of demo applications showcasing the possibilities
that the pyRAP framework offers.

      The `controls` demo app showcases the rich set of graphical widgets that
      `pyRAP` offers. It is at the same time supposed to serve as a reference for
      how to use them and how write web apps in with `pyRAP`. The source of the app
      is shipped with `pyRAP` and can be found in the folder ``examples/controls``.
      You can try out the controls app at
