Welcome to pyrap's documentation!
=================================

`pyrap` is a framework for implementing extremely powerful and 
beautiful web-based AJAX applications in pure Python. No HTML. No 
JavaScript. No PHP. Just pure Python. It has been designed as a 
lightweight, easy-to-use yet powerful library that makes development of
`SaaS applications <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service>`_
as easy and fast as possible.
