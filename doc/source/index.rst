Welcome to pyRAP!
=================

`pyrap` is a framework for implementing extremely powerful and 
beautiful web-based AJAX applications in pure Python. No HTML. No 
JavaScript. No PHP. Just pure Python. It has been designed as a 
lightweight, easy-to-use yet powerful library that makes development of
`SaaS applications <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service>`_
as easy and fast as possible.

Showroom
--------

The showroom contains a couple of demo applications showcasing the possibilities
that the pyRAP framework offers.

      The `controls` demo app showcases the rich set of graphical widgets that
      `pyRAP` offers. It is at the same time supposed to serve as a reference for
      how to use them and how write web apps in with `pyRAP`. The source of the app
      is shipped with `pyRAP` and can be found in the folder ``examples/controls``.
      You can try out the controls app at

      `pracmln` is a artificial intelligence toolbox for statistical relational
      learning developed at the University of Bremen. It provides a web interface
      to the learning and reasoning algorithms for Markov logic networks, which
      is entirely written in `pyRAP`. For further information about `pracmln`,
      please visit the `project webpage <http://www.pracmln.org>`_.

        `PRAC` is a natural-language interpreter for robotic applications. It is
        being developed by the Institute for Artificial Intelligence  at the University
        of Bremen and can be accessed via a web interface written in `pyRAP`.
        For further infromation about `PRAC`, we refer to the project `web page <http://www.actioncores.org>`_.
