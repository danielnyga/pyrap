Working with Logger adapters
============================

**N.B.** This is part of the standard library since Python 2.6 / 3.1, so the
version here is for use with earlier Python versions.

The class was enhanced for Python 3.2, so you may wish to use this version
with earlier Python versions.

However, note that the :class:`~logutils.adapter.LoggerAdapter` class will **not**
work with Python 2.4 or earlier, as it uses the `extra` keyword argument which
was added in later Python versions.
