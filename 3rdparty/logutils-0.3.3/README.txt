logutils 0.3.3
==============
The logutils package provides a set of handlers for the Python standard
library's logging package.

Some of these handlers are out-of-scope for the standard library, and
so they are packaged here. Others are updated versions which have
appeared in recent Python releases, but are usable with older versions
of Python and so are packaged here.

Requirements & Installation
---------------------------
The logutils package requires Python 2.5 or greater, and can be
installed with the standard Python installation procedure:

  python setup.py install

There is a set of unit tests which you can invoke with

  python setup.py test
  
before running the installation.
